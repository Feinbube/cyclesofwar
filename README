         - Welcome to the world of interstellar warfare. -


Getting Started: the Graphical User Interface
/////////////////////////////////////////////

Quick Start
* Just start the game using the Main Window.
* Watch the champions of the other players go berserk on each other.
* You can always hit ESC to go to the main menu and change settings.

Main Window
* The start screen consists of three parts: a list of the champions,
  an area for the game settings and three buttons to launch one of
  the game modes: LIVE MODE, TOURNAMENT MODE and ARENA MODE.
* In the upper area you can see the champions that are known to the
  game. Each of them contains the name and colors that its creator
  chose for himself and this bot.
* Some bots are created by "B". These are training bots that have
  very simple strategies and are intended to be used for the
  development of your own champions. All the other bots are the
  champions of other players participating in the game.
* In the settings area above the launch buttons, there are three 
  settings you can modify: First of all you can choose the number of 
  matches that the champions have to play in TOURNAMENT MODE and 
  ARENA MODE. You can also choose the number of neutral planets that 
  are to be added to the universe for each champion. (20 additional 
  planets with 2 champions means 42 planets in the universe) 
  Furthermore you can choose the size of the universe. This is 
  important to allow 25 and more planets in one map since there is a 
  rule that each planet has to have an approriate distance to its 
  next neighbor. (If you choose a small universe and lots of 
  planets, the planet placing algorithm might have a hard time 
  creating a suitable universe.)
* The different game modes are described below.

LIVE MODE
* Starting a game in LIVE MODE will show you one instance of a fight
  of the champions that were selected in the Main Window.
* The screen is filled with a view on the universe with planets and 
  fleets of the warfaring champions. (For ease of identification, 
  planets and fleets are depicted with the champions color.) 
  In addition there is a summary at the top left corner of the 
  screen. For each champion the current numbers of [P]lanets and 
  [F]leets are depicted. (P[number of planets/accumulated amount of 
  forces on planets])
* The number on each planet shows the amount of forces that are 
  currently residing on. This number will increase over time until
  a fleet is sent. The size of the planets represents their 
  respective force production rate. Larger planets produce forces 
  faster than smaller ones. In the beginning, each champion gets one 
  of the largest planets. All the other planets are neutral and will 
  not produce additional forces until conquered by a champion. 
* Fleets are rendered in different sizes, representing the actual
  amount of forces they are representing. Large forces will also 
  display this number directly. They can also fly in different
  formations. Like colors, they can be chosen by the player and come
  with no tactical benefits.
* The F1 or 1 key will show you the key mappings for live mode: 
  +/- change the speed of the simulation. SPACE pauses it. Key 5 will
  generate a new universe and start a new combat. Key 6 will reset
  and replay the current universe. Key 7 will reset the universe, put
  the champions on different planets and start the simulation from 
  there.
* Fights can be replayed reliably because every simulation has a 
  unique seed. It is shown in the top right corner after pressing the
  F1 or 1 key.

TOURNAMENT MODE
* This mode is like a summary of the outcomes of a number of LIVE
  MODE combats. It ranks the champions by their overall performance.
  Games run way faster than in LIVE MODE and you get a better 
  feeling of the actual strength of the champions.
* TOURNAMENT MODE will start paused. You have to hit the SPACE bar to
  start the actual tournament. Hitting SPACE again will pause the
  execution. Key 5 will generate a new tournament (also paused).
* If a champion has won at least one game you can view one of those
  games in LIVE MODE by CLICKing on the percentage in front of his
  name.
* The last line counts the numbers of matches that nobody has won.
  You can also view those matches by CLICKing on the percentage.

ARENA MODE
* This mode is like the summary of the outcomes of a number of LIVE
  MODE combats with only two combatants at a time. Each champion is
  playing the same number of games against each other champion. To
  control for fortunate starting positions, each map is played twice
  and starting positions are swapped for the second combat. The 
  table orders champions by their overall performance. In addition 
  the individual performances against the other champions are listed.
  (A percentage of 33% means that the champion in the row has won 
  33% of all games against the champion in the column.) Games run 
  way faster than in LIVE MODE and you get a better feeling of the 
  actual strength of the champions.
* ARENA MODE will start paused. You have to hit the SPACE bar to
  start the actual tournament. Hitting SPACE again will pause the
  execution. Key 5 will generate a new tournament (also paused). If
  you are primarily interested in the performance of some particular
  champions you can mark them by CLICKing on their names. The fights
  of those champions will then be scheduled first, allowing you to
  get a faster insight into their performance.
* You can see all the fights by CLICKing on the respective 
  percentage. (Due to the nature of the layout the champion that
  owns the row you CLICK on will win the game if the percentage
  is more than 0%.)
* The last line counts the numbers of matches that nobody has won.
  You can also view those matches by CLICKing on the percentage.


Getting Involved: shaping your own personal champion
////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Rules Of The Game
* The PLAYER is the shaper of the universe. he has a number of 
  planets and can send fleets to conquer even more of them. Each 
  player starts with a single planet. In addition to the planets of 
  the champions there is a number of neutral planets in the universe 
  as well. A player can only interact with the universe by sending 
  fleets from planets he owns to other planets. /*sendFleet()*/ The 
  game is simulated in rounds. In each round the player knows 
  everything about the universe except the current moves of his 
  opponents in this round. He can acquire all this information by 
  using his API /*getOtherPlayers(), getPlanets(), getFleets()*/.
* The logic of each simulation rounds is as follows: First, the 
  forces on all planets are increased by the production rate of that
  planet. Then, the fleets are moved by the global constant flight
  speed of the universe. Fleets that have reached their destination
  land on it - in the correct order. If the planet and the fleet 
  belong to the same player, the fleet forces are added to the planet
  forces. If planet and fleet belong to differen players, the planet
  forces are reduced by the fleet forces. If forces of the fleet are
  larger than the ones of the planet, the player owning the fleet 
  will own the planet after the encounter. If there is only one 
  player left, he is the declared the winner and the game is over.
  Otherwise all players get time to think /*think()*/ and change the
  the state of the universe by sending fleets. These changes can 
  only be seen in the next round. If nobody has send a fleet for 1000
  rounds or the game runs into its 100000th round without beeing won,
  the game is over and nobody wins. The next simulation round is 
  started.
* The game is all about PLANETs. Get as much as you can ;) Every 
  planet has a position in the 2-dimensional universe that can be 
  acquired using /*getX()*/ and/*getY()*/ Every round a planet
  produces some troops for its owner. The numbers can be acquired 
  using /*getForces()*/ and /*getProductionRatePerRound()*/ The 
  distance to the next planet is always so big that you need at 
  least one round to send a fleet there. The actual number of 
  distance can be acquired using /*getDistanceTo()*/
* The only way to actively interact with the universe is by sending 
  FLEETs from planets you own to other planets. Every fleet has a 
  position in the 2-dimensional universe, that can be acquired using 
  /*getX()*/ and/*getY()*/, and a static amount of troops that can 
  be acquired using /*getForce()*/. Every round each fleet is moved 
  closer to the target. /*roundsToTarget()*/ The distance between 
  two planets is always so big that it takes more than a round to 
  send a fleet there. You can also choose between various formations.
  Though this is just a rendering gimmick and does not affect game 
  logic at all, it can be helpful to use different formations to 
  visualize the different purposes of the fleet. (e.g. O-Formation 
  for supporting fleets and V-Formations for attacking fleets.)
* Every player known to the game is registered in the ARENA. Each 
  human is allowed to appoint one of his players to fight as his 
  champion in the nightly arena tournaments. Two kind of tournaments 
  will be held: For the 1-ON-1-TOURNAMENT a number of universes with 
  space for only two players is generated. Each champion fights two 
  matches against each other champion in those. In the second of 
  these matches the starting positions are swapped. The champions 
  are ranked by the total amount of matches that they've won. The 
  LAST-MAN-STANDING-TOURNAMENT composes of a series of matches that 
  involve all unranked champions. The player with the highest win 
  rate is ranked; all others compete for the next rank in the same
  way.

Train Your Champion
* You can download the current version of the game from here.
* Please add your bot as a new class into your own package: 
  e.g. /*public class CptAwesome extends Player { }*/ 
  in /*cyclesofwar.players.john*/. You will have to implement the
  PLAYER interface by providing your name, choosing your colors and
  implementing the method /*think()*/. In this method all your
  interactions with the universe will take place. Use /*this*/ to 
  acquire information and /*sendFleet()*/ unleash your forces.
* If you want to get more information about the framework have a
  look at the following classes in the cyclesofwar package: 
  Player, Fleet, Planet, Arena, Prediction, Advise, GameObject.
* Have a look at the various training bots that are implementing
  a diverse set of strategies and demonstrate the usage of the game
  API. The bots are ordered by difficulty: B00_Idle being the
  easiest one, B01_ChaseMe being slightly better.. and so on. 
* If you can beat all the training bots it's time to register your 
  champion in the arena for the nightly tournaments.
