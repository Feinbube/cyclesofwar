         - Welcome to the world of interstellar warfare. -


Getting Started
///////////////

Quick Start
* Just start the game using the Main Window.
* Choose two or more champions from the upper area of the screen and
  click on LIVE MODE to watch them going berserk on each other.
* You can always hit ESC to go back to the main menu and change
  settings.

Main Window
* The start screen consists of three parts: a list of the champions,
  an area for the game settings and three buttons to launch one of
  the game modes: LIVE MODE, TOURNAMENT MODE and ARENA MODE.
* In the upper area you can see the champions that are known to the
  game. Each of them contains the name and colors that its creator
  chose for himself and this bot.
* Some bots are created by "B". These are training bots that have
  very simple strategies and are intended to be used for the
  development of your own champion. All the other bots are the
  champions of other people participating in the game.
* There are three settings you can modify: First of all you can
  choose the number of matches that the champions have to play in 
  TOURNAMENT MODE and ARENA MODE. You can also choose the number of
  neutral planets that are to be added to the universe for each
  champion. (20 additional planets with 2 champions means 42 planets
  in the universe) Furthermore you can choose the size of the
  universe. This is important to allow 25 and more planets in one map
  since there is a rule that each planet has to have an approriate
  distance to its next neighbor. (If you choose a small universe and
  lots of planets, the planet placing algorithm might have a hard
  time creating a suitable universe.)
* The different game modes are described below.

LIVE MODE
*

TOURNAMENT MODE
*

ARENA MODE
*



GUI
* F1...Shows the key mapping
* ESC...opens the menu
* Try clicking everything in the menu. Usually something magical happens. ;)
* Please be advised, that you can only increase the number of planets to large numbers,
  if you increase the scale of the universe also. Sorry for the inconvenience.
  
Game Modes
* LIVE MODE: shows you one game featuring the generals you selected.
* TOURNAMENT MODE: same as live mode, but with more games and tabular visualization
  + Games run faster this way and you get a better feeling of the actual strength of the players
  + Click on one of the percentages to see one of the games producing that outcome
* ARENA MODE: only two generals at a time. Each general plays against each other. 
  + To make it fair, each map is played twice, starting positions are swapped.
  + Games run faster this way and you get a better feeling of the actual strength of the players
  + Click on one of the percentages to see one of the games producing that outcome 


Getting Involved
////////////////

Dedicated 1-On-1, Tournament with Arena rules
100 10 1.0
100 10 1.0 iterative


* Bots are ordered by difficulty: B00_Idle being the easiest one,
  B01_ChaseMe being slightly better.. and so on. 

Rules Of The Game

/* PLAYER
 * the player is the shaper of the universe. he has a number of planets and can send fleets to conquer even more of them
 * 
 * a player starts with a single planet
 * a player can only interact with the universe by sending fleets from planets he owns to other planets
 * 
 * get your opponents by using getOtherPlayers()
 * get your planets by using getPlanets()
 * get your fleets by using getFleets()
 * send forces using sendFleet()
 * 
 * logic of the game per round:
 * 		forces on all planets are increased
 * 		fleets are moved
 * 		fleets that have reached their destination land on it: (in the correct order)
 * 			planet and fleet belong to the same player: fleet forces join planet forces
 * 			planet and fleet belong to different players: planet forces are reduced by fleet forces. planet may change owner.
 * 		if there is only one player left: he is the winner, game is over
 * 		all players think. local changes to the universe (by sending fleets) can not be seen by player until next round
 * 		if nobody has sent a fleet for 1.000 rounds: game is over, nobody wins
 * 		if the game exceeds 100.000 rounds: game is over, nobody wins
 * 		start next round
 
 /* FLEET
 * the only way to actively interact with the universe is sending fleets from planets you own to other planets
 * 
 * every fleet has a position in the 2-dimensional universe. (position can be acquired using getX() and getY())
 * every fleet consists of a static number of troops. (use getForce() to see their number)
 * every round a fleet is moved closer to the target. (numbers can be acquired using roundsToTarget())
 * if a fleet arrives at a planet, the following happens to the forces at that planet:
 * 		planet and fleet belong to the same player: fleet forces join planet forces
 * 		planet and fleet belong to different players: planet forces are reduced by fleet forces. planet may change owner.
 * the distance to the next planet is always so big that you need at least one round to send a fleet there
 * 
 * you can also chose between various formations (which is just a rendering gimmick and does not affect game logic at all)
 */
 
 /* ARENA
 * here new players are registered and tournaments are configured
 */
 
 /* PLANET
 * the game is all about planets. get as much as you can ;)
 * 
 * every planet has a position in the 2-dimensional universe. (position can be acquired using getX() and getY())
 * every round a planet produces some troops for its owner. (numbers can be acquired using getForces() and getProductionRatePerRound())
 * the distance to the next planet is always so big that you need at least one round to send a fleet there
