         - Welcome to the world of interstellar warfare. -


Getting Started
///////////////

Quick Start
* Just start the game using the Main Window.
* Watch the champions of the other players go berserk on each other.
* You can always hit ESC to go to the main menu and change settings.

Main Window
* The start screen consists of three parts: a list of the champions,
  an area for the game settings and three buttons to launch one of
  the game modes: LIVE MODE, TOURNAMENT MODE and ARENA MODE.
* In the upper area you can see the champions that are known to the
  game. Each of them contains the name and colors that its creator
  chose for himself and this bot.
* Some bots are created by "B". These are training bots that have
  very simple strategies and are intended to be used for the
  development of your own champions. All the other bots are the
  champions of other players participating in the game.
* In the settings area above the launch buttons, there are three 
  settings you can modify: First of all you can choose the number of 
  matches that the champions have to play in TOURNAMENT MODE and 
  ARENA MODE. You can also choose the number of neutral planets that 
  are to be added to the universe for each champion. (20 additional 
  planets with 2 champions means 42 planets in the universe) 
  Furthermore you can choose the size of the universe. This is 
  important to allow 25 and more planets in one map since there is a 
  rule that each planet has to have an approriate distance to its 
  next neighbor. (If you choose a small universe and lots of 
  planets, the planet placing algorithm might have a hard time 
  creating a suitable universe.)
* The different game modes are described below.

LIVE MODE
* Starting a game in LIVE MODE will show you one instance of a fight
  of the champions that were selected in the Main Window.
* The screen is filled with a view on the universe with planets and 
  fleets of the warfaring champions. (For ease of identification, 
  planets and fleets are depicted with the champions color.) 
  In addition there is a summary at the top left corner of the 
  screen. For each champion the current numbers of [P]lanets and 
  [F]leets are depicted. (P[number of planets/accumulated amount of 
  forces on planets])
* The number on each planet shows the amount of forces that are 
  currently residing on. This number will increase over time until
  a fleet is sent. The size of the planets represents their 
  respective force production rate. Larger planets produce forces 
  faster than smaller ones. In the beginning, each champion gets one 
  of the largest planets. All the other planets are neutral and will 
  not produce additional forces until conquered by a champion. 
* Fleets are rendered in different sizes, representing the actual
  amount of forces they are representing. Large forces will also 
  display this number directly. They can also fly in different
  formations. Like colors, they can be chosen by the player and come
  with no tactical benefits.
* The F1 or 1 key will show you the key mappings for live mode: 
  +/- change the speed of the simulation. SPACE pauses it. Key 5 will
  generate a new universe and start a new combat. Key 6 will reset
  and replay the current universe. Key 7 will reset the universe, put
  the champions on different planets and start the simulation from 
  there.
* Fights can be replayed reliably because every simulation has a 
  unique seed. It is shown in the top right corner after pressing the
  F1 or 1 key.

TOURNAMENT MODE
* This mode is like a summary of the outcomes of a number of LIVE
  MODE combats. It ranks the players by their overall performance.
* TOURNAMENT MODE will start paused. You have to hit the SPACE bar to
  start the actual tournament. Hitting SPACE again will pause the
  execution. Key 5 will generate a new tournament (also paused).
* If a champion won at least one game you can view one of those games
  by CLICKing on the percentage in front of his name.

ARENA MODE
* ARENA MODE will start paused. You have to hit the SPACE bar to
  start the actual tournament.



GUI
* F1...Shows the key mapping
* ESC...opens the menu
* Try clicking everything in the menu. Usually something magical happens. ;)
* Please be advised, that you can only increase the number of planets to large numbers,
  if you increase the scale of the universe also. Sorry for the inconvenience.
  
Game Modes
* LIVE MODE: shows you one game featuring the generals you selected.
* TOURNAMENT MODE: same as live mode, but with more games and tabular visualization
  + Games run faster this way and you get a better feeling of the actual strength of the players
  + Click on one of the percentages to see one of the games producing that outcome
* ARENA MODE: only two generals at a time. Each general plays against each other. 
  + To make it fair, each map is played twice, starting positions are swapped.
  + Games run faster this way and you get a better feeling of the actual strength of the players
  + Click on one of the percentages to see one of the games producing that outcome 


Getting Involved
////////////////

Dedicated 1-On-1, Tournament with Arena rules
100 10 1.0
100 10 1.0 iterative


* Bots are ordered by difficulty: B00_Idle being the easiest one,
  B01_ChaseMe being slightly better.. and so on. 

Rules Of The Game

/* PLAYER
 * the player is the shaper of the universe. he has a number of planets and can send fleets to conquer even more of them
 * 
 * a player starts with a single planet
 * a player can only interact with the universe by sending fleets from planets he owns to other planets
 * 
 * get your opponents by using getOtherPlayers()
 * get your planets by using getPlanets()
 * get your fleets by using getFleets()
 * send forces using sendFleet()
 * 
 * logic of the game per round:
 * 		forces on all planets are increased
 * 		fleets are moved
 * 		fleets that have reached their destination land on it: (in the correct order)
 * 			planet and fleet belong to the same player: fleet forces join planet forces
 * 			planet and fleet belong to different players: planet forces are reduced by fleet forces. planet may change owner.
 * 		if there is only one player left: he is the winner, game is over
 * 		all players think. local changes to the universe (by sending fleets) can not be seen by player until next round
 * 		if nobody has sent a fleet for 1.000 rounds: game is over, nobody wins
 * 		if the game exceeds 100.000 rounds: game is over, nobody wins
 * 		start next round
 
 /* FLEET
 * the only way to actively interact with the universe is sending fleets from planets you own to other planets
 * 
 * every fleet has a position in the 2-dimensional universe. (position can be acquired using getX() and getY())
 * every fleet consists of a static number of troops. (use getForce() to see their number)
 * every round a fleet is moved closer to the target. (numbers can be acquired using roundsToTarget())
 * if a fleet arrives at a planet, the following happens to the forces at that planet:
 * 		planet and fleet belong to the same player: fleet forces join planet forces
 * 		planet and fleet belong to different players: planet forces are reduced by fleet forces. planet may change owner.
 * the distance to the next planet is always so big that you need at least one round to send a fleet there
 * 
 * you can also chose between various formations (which is just a rendering gimmick and does not affect game logic at all)
 */
 
 /* ARENA
 * here new players are registered and tournaments are configured
 */
 
 /* PLANET
 * the game is all about planets. get as much as you can ;)
 * 
 * every planet has a position in the 2-dimensional universe. (position can be acquired using getX() and getY())
 * every round a planet produces some troops for its owner. (numbers can be acquired using getForces() and getProductionRatePerRound())
 * the distance to the next planet is always so big that you need at least one round to send a fleet there
