Dear Cadet,

welcome to the world of interstellar warfare. This is your brief mission briefing. :)


Getting Started
* Just start the game, select some of the generals and watch them going berserk in live mode. [see GUI]
* There are 
* Bots are ordered by difficulty: B00_Idle being the easiest one, B01_ChaseMe being slightly better.. and so on. 

GUI
* F1...Shows the key mapping
* ESC...opens the menu
* Try clicking everything in the menu. Usually something magical happens. ;)
* Please be advised, that you can only increase the number of planets to large numbers,
  if you increase the scale of the universe also. Sorry for the inconvenience.
  
Game Modes
* LIVE MODE: shows you one game featuring the generals you selected.
* TOURNAMENT MODE: same as live mode, but with more games and tabular visualization
  + Games run faster this way and you get a better feeling of the actual strength of the players
  + Click on one of the percentages to see one of the games producing that outcome
* ARENA MODE: only two generals at a time. Each general plays against each other. 
  + To make it fair, each map is played twice, starting positions are swapped.
  + Games run faster this way and you get a better feeling of the actual strength of the players
  + Click on one of the percentages to see one of the games producing that outcome 


Rules Of The Game

/* PLAYER
 * the player is the shaper of the universe. he has a number of planets and can send fleets to conquer even more of them
 * 
 * a player starts with a single planet
 * a player can only interact with the universe by sending fleets from planets he owns to other planets
 * 
 * get your opponents by using getOtherPlayers()
 * get your planets by using getPlanets()
 * get your fleets by using getFleets()
 * send forces using sendFleet()
 * 
 * logic of the game per round:
 * 		forces on all planets are increased
 * 		fleets are moved
 * 		fleets that have reached their destination land on it: (in the correct order)
 * 			planet and fleet belong to the same player: fleet forces join planet forces
 * 			planet and fleet belong to different players: planet forces are reduced by fleet forces. planet may change owner.
 * 		if there is only one player left: he is the winner, game is over
 * 		all players think. local changes to the universe (by sending fleets) can not be seen by player until next round
 * 		if nobody has sent a fleet for 1.000 rounds: game is over, nobody wins
 * 		if the game exceeds 100.000 rounds: game is over, nobody wins
 * 		start next round
 
 /* FLEET
 * the only way to actively interact with the universe is sending fleets from planets you own to other planets
 * 
 * every fleet has a position in the 2-dimensional universe. (position can be acquired using getX() and getY())
 * every fleet consists of a static number of troops. (use getForce() to see their number)
 * every round a fleet is moved closer to the target. (numbers can be acquired using roundsToTarget())
 * if a fleet arrives at a planet, the following happens to the forces at that planet:
 * 		planet and fleet belong to the same player: fleet forces join planet forces
 * 		planet and fleet belong to different players: planet forces are reduced by fleet forces. planet may change owner.
 * the distance to the next planet is always so big that you need at least one round to send a fleet there
 * 
 * you can also chose between various formations (which is just a rendering gimmick and does not affect game logic at all)
 */
 
 /* ARENA
 * here new players are registered and tournaments are configured
 */
 
 /* PLANET
 * the game is all about planets. get as much as you can ;)
 * 
 * every planet has a position in the 2-dimensional universe. (position can be acquired using getX() and getY())
 * every round a planet produces some troops for its owner. (numbers can be acquired using getForces() and getProductionRatePerRound())
 * the distance to the next planet is always so big that you need at least one round to send a fleet there
